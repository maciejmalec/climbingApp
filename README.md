# climbingApp

An iOS app useful as a tool for people that practice bouldering. 

Users, can track their progress on different routes (currently only at a Aber Sports Centre bouldering wall).
The app will supply them with the list of all routes at the centre, alongside of the information about each,
such as the panel number, grade of the route, starting postion or colour of the holds. It will be displayed 
in a form of a list, that could be sorted alphabetically.

Users will be able to mark which routes, they have completed and how many times, what will be displayed in 
an easy to understand progress bar.
